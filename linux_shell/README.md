In this final project for my Computer Systems Class, I worked with a partner to create a tiny Linux Shell in C++ with program control. All of our work, we completed in tsh.cc, and then we tested the functionality using the trace.txt files. Throught this project, I demonstrated my understanding of child and parent processes, as well as the need for signals and signal handlers to have background and foregrond jobs. I scored an A on the interview, as I was able to explain how everything worked together.

In the correct directory, with these files, all one must do is type 'python shellAutograder.py' to test every single one of the trace.txt files. Our shell passes 14/16 of the traces, giving us a 100% on the project.
